# Exercise 2.22 Reprint

Expand the previous program so that the main program asks the user for the number of times the phrase will be printed (i.e. how many times the method will be called).

```python
def main():
    # ask the user for the number of times that the phrase will be printed
    # use the while command to call the method a suitable number of times

def print_text():
    # write some code in here
```

Sample output:

```plaintext
How many times?
**7**
In a hole in the ground there lived a method
In a hole in the ground there lived a method
In a hole in the ground there lived a method
In a hole in the ground there lived a method
In a hole in the ground there lived a method
In a hole in the ground there lived a method
In a hole in the ground there lived a method
```

**NB:** print the prompt `How many times?` on its own separate line!
